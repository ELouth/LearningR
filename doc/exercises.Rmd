# Intro
This entire document is a *practice* session for **learning R**

# Methods and Results
The methods explain **what** we did, the results are the *output*

## Analysis
We may have done an analysis


```{r setup}
source(here::here("R/package-loading.R"))
load(here::here("data/nhanes_small.rda"))
```

```{r prettier-table, echo = FALSE}
nhanes_small %>%
    filter(!is.na(diabetes)) %>%
    group_by(diabetes, sex) %>%
    summarise(mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
              mean_bmi = mean(bmi, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    ungroup() %>% 
    mutate(mean_age = round(mean_age, 1), 
           mean_bmi = round(mean_bmi, 1),
           sex = str_to_sentence(sex)) %>% 
    rename("Diabetes Status" = diabetes, Sex = sex, "Mean Age" = mean_age, "Mean BMI" = mean_bmi) %>% 
    knitr::kable(caption = "Table 1. prettier mean age and BMI")
    

```


# Discussion
Here we discuss the **pros** and *cons* of what we did


```{r kitten-image, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.cap="Sherlock: the cutest thing"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("doc/images/Sherlock.jpg"))

```
