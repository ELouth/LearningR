THis is for the R course and practising R

# brief description

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the data, doc and R folders.

The following folders contain:

- `data/`: processed data for the project
- `doc/`: any related document
- `R/`: code for the project
- `data-raw/`: raw data that you don't touch

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using `usethis::use_package("packagename")`
through the `DESCRIPTION` file, installing dependencies is as easy as opening the
`LearningR.Rproj` file and running this command in the console:

    # install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_deps()

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.
